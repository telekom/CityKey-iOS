# How to contribute

Contributions are very welcome and encouraged. Here, we focus on contributions made via Github.

## Creating Issues

Before creating a new issue, please have a look at the list
of [existing issues](https://github.com/telekom/CityKey-iOS/issues)
to see if it already has been reported. An issue will be closed once it has been fixed
in the source code. This fix however might not have its way to the version of Citykey you are using,
so please don't forget to also check the closed issues.

If the problem you have found is not reported already, please create a new issue and describe what
exactly you did to produce the faulty behavior mentioning the version of Citykey you are using.
Screenshots are always welcome to illustrate your description.

## Creating Pull Requests

If you want to do more than fixing bugs, please create an issue for the feature you want to work
on (if it does not already exist) before doing any major work, so that other developers know about
your plans, can coordinate, prevent duplicated work and discuss the best approach for your
undertaking.
